# Delivery Fee Calculator - Frontend 

## Potential issues & areas of improvement 
- Delivery of 0 items should perhaps cost nothing or give an error message instead. 
- User should be able to see a fee breakdown by clicking on or next to the fee amount. 
  - ... but how should the fee be broken down into components when the sum of the components
    is more than the maximum total fee?
